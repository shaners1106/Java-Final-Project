# ATM Final Project

This repository contains all of the classes and files for my final project in my Java course at Whitworth University.  The project utilized the Swing and AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) components of the JFC (Java Foundation Classes) to construct a model of an ATM (Automated Teller Machine).  The ATM simulation consists of a series of popup windows according to the various functions available to a prospective banking customer.  The program reads in arbitrary customers from a csv file as well as pre-assigned customer transaction information.  This provides functionality for testing the various screens of the ATM.  An ATM customer can deposit money into checking or savings, withdrawl money from checking or savings, check account history and more.
